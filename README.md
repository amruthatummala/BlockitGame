Project Name: Blockit!

Brief Summary of our Game: The objective of our game is to create the desired structure using blocks. The player will first choose the level: easy, medium, or hard. Each level has a corresponding structure to build. In part 1, players collect a certain number of blocks necessary for the structure. Then in part 2, the player uses those blocks to build the structure. Once you build the structure, you will arrive at the victory screen. Yay!
